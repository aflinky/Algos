/**
 * 
 * Given the root of a Binary Search Tree and a target number k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to the given target.
 * 
 * Ex
 * Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
 * Output: true
 * 
 * Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
 * Output: false
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
 * -104 <= Node.val <= 104
 * root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
 * -105 <= k <= 105
