/**
 * You are the technical director of a radio serving listeners nationwide. For simplicity's sake we can consider each listener to live along a horizontal line stretching from 0 (west) to 100 (east)
 * Given a list of N listeners and a list of M radio towers, each placed at various locations along this line, determine waht the minimum broadcast range would have to be in order for each listener's home to be covered
 * 
 * Ex
 * N = [1, 11, 5, 20]
 * M = [4, 8, 15]
 * => 5
